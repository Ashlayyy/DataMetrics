## TodoList

- TODO The entire frontend needs a rewrite to use the composition API instead of the options API
- TODO Better naming of variables, functions etc (frontend and backend folders)
- TODO Creating a User and a Setting Database in mongoDB using mongoose. They will communicate with the Vue app using http requests, so a extra router is needed. The endpoint will be (get, post, put, patch) /api/v1/account/:id and (get, post, put, patch) /api/v1/account/:id/settings
